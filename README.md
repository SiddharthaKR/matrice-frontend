## Project Management System - Frontend

### Overview
This project implements a project management system with a user-friendly interface built using React.js, Redux, and other modern technologies. The application facilitates project and task management, deadline tracking, user authentication, role-based access control, and search/filter functionality.

### Features
1. **User Authentication**: Implements user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access.
2. **Dashboard**: Displays an overview of projects, tasks, deadlines, etc.
3. **Project Management**: Allows users to create, update, and delete projects. Each project can have multiple tasks associated with it.
4. **Task Management**: Provides functionality to add, edit, and delete tasks within each project.
5. **Deadline Tracking**: Shows deadlines for projects and tasks for better organization and planning.
6. **User Roles**: Implements different roles like admin, project manager, and team member with varying levels of access for effective collaboration.
